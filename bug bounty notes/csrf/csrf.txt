csrf cross site requests forgery


in csrf you have to manuplate the requests 

select the endpoint and make your own requests like 

http://127.0.0.1?parameter=value&change_password=value&new_password=value


payload
<script>

xhr = XMLHttpRequest;
xhr.open('GET' , 'url')
xhr.send()


</script>


To steal the csrf token make script which first extract the token and append to the url USE DOM #IMP


# TIPs to bypass the csrf token 
CSRF tokens are injected into forms and sensitive
URLs but are rarely checked and validated on the server side.
If currently logged in as user A then use the CSRF token of any other user B
and check if the request of A is allowed via B's token. Then use this logic to
bypass the CSRF protection.
• Don't delete the anti-CSRF token parameter but put a blank inside its value
and see if it works.
• Put a random string with a similar length to that of the anti-CSRF token.
Check to see if that works.
• Check if the CSRF token is common to all users. If so, then use the token to
construct an exploit.
