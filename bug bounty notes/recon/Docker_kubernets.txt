Exposed Docker Api 
When you install docker on a system it will expose an API on your local host located on port 2375. This API can be used to interact with the docker
engine which basically gives you the right to do anything

To confirm that a desired host is running 
Docker you can make a GET request to the /version endpoint. 
This will print out a json blob as shown below:

127.0.0.1:2375/version      dont use http this are 80 443 

docker ke cli pe jake command run karo                  checks notes/book/good_book 

docker -H 127.0.0.1:2375 ps
