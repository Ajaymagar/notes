Reverse Whois
This method is invoked using the -whois flag. 
Essentially it takes the details from the specified domain’s whois records,
and then tries to find other domains with similar whois records


amass intel -d jio.com -whois


This is a great method for discovering root domains that may be owned by an organisation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ssl Certificate Grabbing 

If you feed IP addresses to Amass and give it the -active flag, it pulls the SSL certificate from every IP address within the IP range and 
then spits back the domain that the SSL cert is associated with.

amass intel -active -cidr  173.0.84.0/24    




---------------- Using ASN ----------------- 
if you want to find ASN of company 

amass intel -org "Tesla"
op == asn nos    verify again 

subdomain using asn 

amass intel -active -asn 394161



------ chaining the commands  -------------- 

amass intel -asn 394161 -whois -d tesla.com


------------------------ Amass enum ------------------------ 

amass enum -d example.com 


amass enum -d example.com -active -cidr 1.2.3.4/24,4.3.2.1/24 -asn 12345


Note that you will 
first need to get the CIDRs and ASNs associated with the organisation using the intel methods outlined earlier in this post.

Tracking
Every scan that you do with amass is automatically stored on the computer that you ran it on. Then, if you run the same scan again, amass will track any changes that have taken place since your last scan. The most obvious way to use this feature is to discover which subdomains have appeared since your last scan. For example, I ran amass enum -d vimeo.com back in June. It’s now August, so I ran the same command again.
Now I can run amass track -d vimeo.com and it will tell me anything that has changed within the last two months.
