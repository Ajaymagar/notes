1 sub domain takeover 
CNAME RECOEDS - A CNAME, or Canonical Name record, is a record that points to another domain address rather than an IP address. 
For example, say you have several subdomains, like www.mydomain.com, ftp.mydomain.com, mail.mydomain.com etc and
 you want these sub domains to point to your main domain name mydomain.com


Dangling CNAME records ( Lazy Admins point to the sub domain but they never clamied that ) so we can claim by using free hosting service like Heroku or Aws

Using altdns we can pass in a list of found subdomains and a list of words and
the tool will output a huge list of permutations. The tool can also resolve each
newly found subdomain to see if they are live:
altdns -i found_subdomains.txt -o permutation_output -w words.txt -r -s
resolved_output.txt





after Sub Domain Enumeration we need to use tools to find live target and vul
