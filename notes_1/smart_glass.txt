1] first function smart reader 

we have three three function in project 
text recognition we are using opencv library for capturing the image apply grayscale filter on image and save the image in same folder

second library is pytesseract which is use for processing the image it convert the detected text into string
read some info from google you can better understand

third lib is gtts which is google text to speech 
this library want input as a string and save the audio in mp3 file google it.

fourth lib is pygame which is for game development but we use it for run the audio file

2] second function know the person  == face recognition

in this function we are usinf same opencv lib for img processing it click the photo
apply the filter graysacle for increasing the efficiency and for face recognition we are using haar cascade machine learning
algorithm proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001.
haar cascade is use for detecting the object for which it has been trained
our programm detect the faces in img and give the count for recognition i will tell you.
above process is same by using string gtts module convert the text into audio 



3] third function voice based smart assitance 

in smart assistance for audio input we are using speech_recogntion module which convert the audio into string 

second module gtts google text to speech which convert the string into audio 

our smart assistance is able to send mail to anyone by only voice command  we are using smtplib protocol of application layers to do that not gmail interface

by using the browser automation we can play video of you tube by voice command

by voice command we fetch the data from  wikipedia  using wikipedia module.
 
our smart assistance tell current  time using time module 


end

modules ka intro padhle net par clear ho jayega 
ye sirf code ka explanation he hardware me kuch nahi he jadya

raspi and pycam and microphone use hoga likh de.
