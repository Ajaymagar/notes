WEB ARCHITECTURE AND COMPONENTS
===============================

1. Domain Name : Its tough for a user to remember the IP address of a website so these websites are assigned with a domain name such as google.com , facebook.com etc etc. So in order to open or access the website one has to visit the domain name.

2. Web Hosting Space : The space which helps in storing the webpages or scripts which helps in running a website are known as hosting spaces. Eg. GoDaddy, BigRock 
ICANN provide these hosting spaces to Godaddy etc.

3. Operating Systems : On which Operating System we want to build our website. Eg. Linux, Windows

4. Server Type : Which type of server we are using to host our website. Request and Response of the application.
		Windows - IIS - Information Server
		Linux - Apache Tomcat 

5. Web Technology :   The technology we use in buliding a  website like the programming languages, the plugins, various scripting languages etc.
To check what technology a site is using :
Visit : builtwith.com

	1. Client Side Scripting Language : Which is used to develop the Front End Application and the user only accessing the control menu of that Programming Language. 
	Eg. HTML , Java etc.

	2. Server Side Scripting Language : THese are those languages which are used for creating and maintaing server side configuration of a website.
	Eg. PHP, ASP, JSP, PYTHON etc.

Server is OS which always responds to the requests of clients.
Clients are those which only requests to the server. 

6. Database : Database is that system which stores all the data of a web application we are hosting in a server. It is known as the backbone of the web application.This data could be anything like username ,password , messages , comments etc.
It helps in storing all the files situated in a database.
Windows - MSSQL
Linux - MySQL, PostgreSQL

                        S Q L
          Structured --> Means a uniform storage like in the form of tables
          Query --> The data stored in the table can be retreived through some queries these queries could be like :
          Select * from <tablename>;
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Local Hosting
=============
Local Hosting is a technology in which we stores and hosts a Database in our "localhost" Computer. This website can be hosted and accessed in a LAN or a Intranet Network.
Can be assessed from the hosted computer by three ways:
1. 127.0.0.1/WEBSITE_NAME
2. localhost/WEBSITE_NAME
3. <private ip>/WEBSITE_NAME


LOCAL HOST SERVERS
==================
So, they are Server applications which makes our normal operating system and make them act like a server.

WINDOWS - WAMPP

W 	-	WINDOWS
A   -	APACHE
M   -	MSSQL
P   -	PERL
P   -	PYTHON

LINUX - LAMMP

L   -	LINUX
A   -	APACHE
M   -	MYSQL
P   -	PERL
P   -	PYTHON

XAMPP - Cross Platform Server
X 	-	Cross Platform
A   -	APACHE
M   -	MYSQL
P   -	PERL
P   -	PYTHON


XAMMP installation and configuration demo...


= Start apache
= Start MySQL

There are 3 ways for opening a server hosted file
c:\xampp\htdocs
------------------------------------------------------------------

WEB SECURITY MISCONCEPTIONS
===========================

HTTP / HTTPS - SSL Secured = Secure Socket Layer
							Encryption
							Tunneling
							Secure Socket

= If a Website is using https instead of http, its not secured either. 
= If I am using a Good Firewall than I am secured.
= If I am using IDS and IPS the I am secured.
	IDS = Intrusion(any obstruction) Detection System
	IPS = Intrusion Prevesion System
------------------------------------------------------------------


SCRIPTING LANGUAGES
===================

Methods used in Scripting Languages
===================================

1. GET = It shows Data which is being traveled from Server to Clients in the URL only. It is the unsecured method of data travelling between client and server.

2. POST = It doesn't show anything in the URL that fromwhere that data is travelling.




Client Side Scrippting
======================
The scripting programming language we are gonna be using is HTML.

HTML --> Hyper text markup language
====
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
  ||
Hyperlinks


This is the application used for creating client side web pages.

HTML PRACTICALS
================

1. Starting of html scripting
<html>
...	
...                         Tell me the code written is in HTML
...
</html>

<head>
..
..                          It is used to define the header like title of the web 									page,name in the tab
</head>

<title> ......
Name of the Title
...</title>

<body>
...
...                         Used for the content of the web page
...
</body>

5. Heading = Used to provide the heading
<h1> - <h6>
As the number increases the font size decreases.
<h1>Heading</h1>
<h2>Heading</h2>
<h3>Heading</h3>


HTML TAGS
=========

<p> = Paragraph
<br> = Break Statement
<ul> = Helps in indentation
<ahref> = Hyperlink Reference
<b> = Bold
<btn> = Button
<a> = Action
<li> = Line
<h1> = Heading
<imgsrc> = Image Source
<form action> =  Form Clicking Action


Basicpage.html
==============
<html>
<head>
<title>Basic</title>
</head>
<body>
<a href="http://www.lucideus.com"><h1>Ethical Hacking</h1></a>
<h2>Black Hat Hacker</h2>
<p>These are the bad guys.<br>
They Just Work For money.<br>
They bring chaos to the cyber world.<br>
Very Very Bad guys.</p>
<h2>White Hat Hacker</h2>
<h3>Script Kiddies</h3>
<h3>N00bZ</h3>
<img src="pooh.jpg">
<form action="secpage.html">
First Name: <input type="text"><br>
Last Name : <input type="text"><br>
Username  : <input type="text"><br>
Password  : <input type="password"><br>
<input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>

Secpage.html
=============
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello user, you are welcome to my web site</h1>
</body>
</html>




** NOTE : Its not neccessary to close the tags i.e. </html> or </body>
  the browser will automatically close it during its running state.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Server Side Scripting
=====================

This language is only used to maintain and coonfigure Server Side Scripting. eg. PHP



PHP
===
<?php = Showing the starting of a php code
?>    = It is the end of the php code
$     = to create a variable
 
variable is a datatype in which we are stroring a value.
    $number = It is a variable and I can store anything in it.
    For Printing = "echo"
    echo "Welcome to Lucideus"
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program of Addition of two numbers Through PHP and HTML
=======================================================

HTML CODE = hello.html

<html>
<head>
  <title>Hello</title>
</head>
<body>
  <form action=calc.php method="post">
    First Number <input type="text" name="first" id="first"><br>
    Sec Number <input type="text" name="sec" id="sec"><br>
    <input type="submit">
  </form>
</body>
</html>

PHP CODE = calc.php

<html>
<head>
  <title>add</title>
</head>

<body>
  <?php
$one = $_POST['first'] + 0;
$two = $_POST['sec'] + 0;
$sum = $one + $two;
echo "The sum is";
echo $sum;
 ?>
</body>
</html>
